## Noteefy

Simple, without authentication, API for ToDos / Notifiers.

## Routes

1. '/api/v1' : Base routes, provides the list of all noteefs
2. '/api/v1/<id:int>: Provides a detail view of a selected noteef, id being the unique identifier of selected noteef

## Future Improvement

1. Authentication
2. Permissions

## Setup

1. Run git clone using this url: https://github.com/Benneee/noteefs.git
2. You're required to have pipenv installed
3. cd into project folder `/noteefy`
4. Run `pipenv shell` to enter virtual environment
5. Run `pipenv install` as this would take care of installing all the dependencies from the Pipfile for you
6. Code away!
